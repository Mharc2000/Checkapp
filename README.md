CheckApp is a telemedicine app with a core function of online consultation and online
medication. The slogan "Healthcare at your convenience" encourages patients to make their
healthcare transaction journey more accessible and easy.

Features of CheckApp:

Online Consultation: With an Internet connection and a smartphone, a patient can speak with
a doctor at any time and from anywhere. The patient and the doctor will have their virtual
medical consultation with this function.

After the online consultation, the patient will receive the following files: E-Medical Certificate
and E-Prescription. An e-Medical certificate that allows the patient to view the doctor's
information as well as the doctor's findings or diagnoses. It also contains an E-Prescription
feature, which allows the doctor to transmit the patient's medicine in digital form.

CheckApp's online pharmacy is one of the features that makes it a one-stop shop for
healthcare transactions. When a patient obtains a prescription or is looking for medication, they
may now explore the medicines on CheckApp's online pharmacy platform. The online pharmacy
functions similarly to a buy-and-sell app, except it, is focused on medical supplies.
